I'm a computer science engineer, passionate about technology and nerdy things.
I'm interested in languages like C++, Go, Python, Lisp and I'm always open to
learning new ones. I like designing lean and efficient systems, thus I won't accept
anything worse than _O(nâ‹…log(n))_ {{< emoji ":satisfied:" >}}. Besides programming,
I appreciate outdoor activities {{< emoji ":herb:" >}} and sports like
mountain biking {{< emoji ":bicyclist:" >}}{{< emoji ":sunrise_over_mountains:" >}}.

My experiences as a professional include:

- Team leader
- Speaker
- Distributed systems
- Embedded systems
- GNU/Linux Kernel drivers
- Bare metal C firmware
- Graphical User Interfaces
- ... and more {{< emoji ":smile:" >}}
